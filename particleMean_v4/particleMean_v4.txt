---- Modify Mean_v3 and use interfaces for event read and process ----

Replace "read" and "dump" global functions to use classes with 
abstract interfaces, as described in the following.
The execution command should be:

execName (main) input fileName
or
execName sim numberOfEvents [seedNumber --> numeri casuali]

***
Take following files from example "braggMean_v4":
- AnalysisSteering.h ,
- AnalysisSteering.cc ,
- EventSource.h ,
- EventSource.cc ,
- EventReadFromFile.h ,
- EventDump.h .
All these files can be used with no modification

***
Create the following files copying the corresponding ones from
"braggMean_v4" and changing the "readFile" and "process" functions,
respectively:
- EventReadFromFile.cc ,
- EventDump.cc .
In EventReadFromFile.cc include in function "readFile" the code formerly
in the global function "read",
In EventDump.cc include in function "process" the code formerly
in the global function "dump".

***
Create a class "ParticleMass", inheriting from "AnalysisSteering" and 
containing a STL array of pointers to "MassMean" objects; use as example
the class "ElementReco" in "braggMean_v4".
Include among the private members a "std::vector pList" of pointers
to MassMean objects (in place of the "bCurve" vector in "ElementReco").
Implement the functions:
- "beginJob" to create and store the pointers to 2 "MassMean" objects 
  for the 2 decay modes, using the same mass ranges as for previous versions
  (in the same way as "BraggMean" pointers are stored in "bCurve"),
- in "endJob" loop over the "MassMean" objects and for each one 
  compute mean and rms masses and print results (in the same way as there's
  a loop over "BraggMean" objects to compute and print results),
- in "process" loop over the "MassMean" objects and for each one 
  call the "add" function (in the same way as each event is added to 
  all "BraggMean" objects).

***
Modify the "main" function to use the modified classes using the 
file "main.cc" from example "braggMean_v4" as reference (change the 
analyzers: "ParticleMass" in place of "ElementReco").
To simulate events use the "EventSim" class.
