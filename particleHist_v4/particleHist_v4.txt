---- Modify Hist_v3 and use dispatcher&observers to loop over events ----


**** Part A ****

***
Download the "Utilities" package and install it somewhere, then 
add the corresponding path in the compilation: 
cd ..../corsocxx
tar -xzf util.tgz
c++ -I ..../corsocxx

***
In "AnalysisSteering.h" remove the "process" function declaration. OK

***
In "EventDump.h,cc" and "ParticleMass.h,cc":
- include the Observer header:
#include "util/include/ActiveObserver.h" OK
- inherit from "ActiveObserver<Event>" in addition to the existing base, OK
- rename the function "process" as "update". OK

***
In "EventSource.h,cc":
- declare the "get" function as "private", OK 
- declare and implement a "public" function "run", OK 
- move the event loop from the "main" function to the new "run" function, OK 
  and use "Dispatcher<Event>::notify" in the event loop. OK 

***
Create a class "ParticleReco" to compute total energy and invariant mass:
- declare it to inherit from the template "Singleton" in the util directory, OK
- declare it to inherit from "LazyObserver", OK
- declare 3 private member variables for the decay properties
    decay type (an enum), OK
    total energy, OK
    invariant mass, OK
- compute those variables in the "update" function, using the code formerly
  in the "mass" global function, OK
- declare and implement functions to check for new events and return the
  decay properties. OK

***
In "MassMean.cc" and "ParticleMass.cc" get the invariant mass from
"ParticleReco" by getting the instance of it and calling the function
returning the invariant mass. OK

***
In "ParticleMass.cc" name the histogram as "mass" followed by the name
given as first parameter in the "pCreate" function. OK

***
Modify the "main" function and replace the event loop with a call to 
the "run" function in the "EventSource". OK




**** Part B ****

***
Add a new quantity "lightVelocity" in Constants.h,cc and set it at
0.029979246 cm/ps OK

***
Duplicate the following classes:        OK
ParticleReco -> ProperTime
MassMean     -> LifetimeFit
ParticleMass -> ParticleLifetime
This can be done quite easily using the command
..../util/class/cloneClass XXX YYY
where XXX is the existing class (e.g. ParticleReco)
and   YYY is the new      class (e.g. ProperTime)

***
In "ProperTime.h" declare a member variable "time" and a function "decayTime"
returning it after checking for new event. OK
In "ProperTime.cc" in the "update" function compute the decay proper time
from the distance "d" of the decay point from the origin using the formula:
t = d*m/(p*c) --> Ã¨ ragionevole mettere il valore vero della massa della particella se vogliamo
where "m" is the invariant mass, "c" the light velocity and "p" the momentum,
given in turn by
p = sqrt(e^2-m^2) --> bisogna mettere il valore calcolato della massa della particella (altrimenti gli errori non vanno bene)
where "e" is the total energy; get the invariant mass and the total energy
from "ParticleReco".      OK

***
In "LifetimeFit.h" declare the same member variables and functions as in
"MassMean", but remove the member variables to hold sums, mean and rms
and the functions returning them; leave the member variables to hold
min. and max. mass and number of events plus the function returning this
last number. OK
In "LifetimeFit.cc" in the "add" function simply check if the invariant mass
is inside the range and update the number of accepted events accordingly;
the function "compute" can be left empty. OK

***
In "ParticleLifetime.h" replace the pointer to "MassMean" with a pointer
to "LifetimeFit" in the "Particle" struct and add two more parameters
"timeMin" and "timeMax" to the "pCreate" function, for min. and max.
decay proper time. OK
In "ParticleLifetime.cc" 

in the "beginJob" function call "pCreate" with
the same arguments as in "ParticleMass", plus the min. and max. time
(use 10.0-500.0 and 10.0-1000.0 as ranges); OK

in the "endJob" function
leave the same operations as in "ParticleMass" but the writing of mean
and rms (leave the call to the "compute" function, that does not anything
for now, it will be implemented in the next version); get from the 
"AnalysisInfo" object the name of the output ROOT file. OK

In the "pCreate" function name the histogram as "time" followed by the name
given as first parameter in the "pCreate" function and use the min. and max.
decay times as range.

In the "update" function call the "add" function of the "LifetimeFit" object,
and fill the histogram according to the result (use the same logic as in
"ParticleMass").

**** optional ****

Save the mass and decay time histograms on the same ROOT file; use a
TFileProxy (in the "util" package, include directory) to handle multiple access to the
same ROOT files in the same run.
